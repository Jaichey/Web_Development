        <h1 class=" text text-center" style="font-size:70px">Paris</h1>
        <p id="visit">
            Paris, the "City of Light," is one of the most iconic and romantic destinations in the world. Known for its
            stunning architecture, rich history, vibrant culture, and artistic heritage, Paris attracts millions of
            visitors every year. From the grandeur of its monuments to the charm of its quaint streets, the city offers
            something for everyone. Here, we explore some of the most famous landmarks as well as lesser-known treasures
            that make Paris a truly magical destination. <br><br>

            <b>The Eiffel Tower: Symbol of Paris</b><br>
            No trip to Paris is complete without a visit to the Eiffel Tower, the most recognizable landmark in the
            world. Constructed in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle, this iron tower stands 324 meters tall and offers
            breathtaking views of the city. Visitors can take an elevator or climb the stairs to the top, where they are
            rewarded with panoramic vistas of Paris’s sprawling boulevards, the Seine River, and other famous landmarks.
            At night, the tower sparkles with thousands of lights, making it a symbol of Parisian elegance and romance.
            <br><br>

            <b>The Louvre: A World of Art and History</b><br>
            The Louvre Museum is another must-visit destination, housing one of the most extensive and important art
            collections in the world. Originally a royal palace, the Louvre became a museum in 1793 and is now home to
            masterpieces such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo, and Eugène Delacroix’s Liberty
            Leading the People. The museum's iconic glass pyramid at the entrance adds a modern twist to the grandeur of
            its classical architecture. Visitors can easily spend an entire day wandering through its vast galleries,
            exploring works from ancient civilizations to modern art. <br><br>

            <b>Notre-Dame Cathedral: Gothic Grandeur</b><br>
            The Notre-Dame Cathedral, located on the Île de la Cité in the heart of Paris, is a masterpiece of French
            Gothic architecture. Built between the 12th and 14th centuries, it is renowned for its intricate sculptures,
            towering spires, and stunning stained-glass windows. The cathedral’s rose windows are particularly famous
            for their beauty and craftsmanship. Though a fire in 2019 caused significant damage, Notre-Dame remains one
            of Paris’s most beloved landmarks, and restoration efforts are ongoing. Climbing to the top of its towers
            offers a striking view of Paris, with the Seine River winding below. <br><br>

            <b>Montmartre: The Bohemian Heart of Paris</b><br>
            For a more intimate and artistic experience, visitors can explore the Montmartre district. Known for its
            bohemian history, Montmartre was once home to famous artists like Pablo Picasso, Vincent van Gogh, and Henri
            Matisse. At its summit sits the stunning Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur, offering one of the best panoramic
            views of Paris. The narrow, cobblestone streets of Montmartre are filled with charming cafes, art studios,
            and street performers, capturing the creative spirit of the city. Place du Tertre, a bustling square, is the
            perfect place to watch artists at work, creating portraits and landscapes. <br><br>

            <b>The Seine River: Life and Leisure Along the Water</b><br>
            The Seine River is the lifeblood of Paris, dividing the city into its Left and Right Banks. A walk along the
            river offers views of some of Paris’s most iconic landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and
            Notre-Dame Cathedral. River cruises are a popular way to see the city from a different perspective,
            especially at night when the city is illuminated. The banks of the Seine are also lined with bouquinistes,
            open-air booksellers who have been a part of Parisian life for centuries, offering a charming reminder of
            the city’s literary history. <br><br>

            <b>The Champs-Élysées and Arc de Triomphe: A Grand Avenue</b><br>
            The Champs-Élysées is one of the most famous avenues in the world, stretching from the Place de la Concorde
            to the Arc de Triomphe. This wide boulevard is lined with shops, cafes, theaters, and luxury brands, making
            it a hub of Parisian life. The Arc de Triomphe, commissioned by Napoleon in 1806, stands at the top of the
            avenue, honoring those who fought for France during the Napoleonic Wars. Visitors can climb to the top for
            another stunning view of the city, with the Champs-Élysées stretching out below. <br><br>

            <b>The Latin Quarter: Intellectual and Cultural Hub</b><br>
            For a taste of Paris’s intellectual history, the Latin Quarter is the place to be. Home to the Sorbonne
            University, this area has long been associated with students, writers, and thinkers. The quarter is filled
            with narrow streets, bustling bookstores, and lively cafes, offering a more relaxed and intellectual
            atmosphere. The Jardin du Luxembourg, a beautiful garden in the heart of the Latin Quarter, provides a
            peaceful escape from the busy city streets, where visitors can stroll among statues, fountains, and flower
            beds. <br><br>

            <b>Conclusion</b><br>
            Paris is a city of endless beauty and cultural richness. From the towering elegance of the Eiffel Tower to
            the charming streets of Montmartre, it offers an incredible array of experiences for travelers. Whether
            you're a lover of art, history, food, or simply the magic of walking along the Seine, Paris has something to
            offer everyone. Each visit reveals a new layer of its charm, leaving visitors eager to return again and
            again.

                        Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (HYD), Hyderabad, India

                        Arrival at the airport:

                        Arrive at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at least 3 hours before your flight for

                        Most common routes are with one-stop layovers. Direct flights are rare, so you'll typically have

                        Transit process:

                        On arrival at your layover airport (Dubai, Doha, Abu Dhabi, etc.), follow signs for
